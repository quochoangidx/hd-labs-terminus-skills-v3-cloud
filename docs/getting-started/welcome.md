# Welcome to Terminus 3

## Latest Updates

Recent announcements. **[See the full Changelog →](/portal/changelog)**

| Date         | Type   | Change |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Jul 31, 2026 | 🆕 New | **Terminus 3 is now live.** Terminus 2nd Edition has concluded. The docs now cover Terminus 3: a new task category taxonomy, four empirical difficulty tiers, and a verifier that runs in a separate container. Milestone tasks are no longer part of the program. ***[Start with What's New](/portal/docs/getting-started/whats-new)*** |

## What is Terminus 3?

Terminus 3 is Snorkel's expert-authored dataset targeting **Terminal-Bench 3.0**, a benchmark for evaluating AI coding agents on genuinely difficult, domain-grounded work.

Earlier editions asked agents to perform a difficult terminal or software task. Terminus 3 asks for something harder: tasks where the agent must **understand a specialized domain, manipulate the right system inside it, and produce a result that satisfies several interacting constraints at once** — verified against checks it cannot see.

Your job is to create those tasks.

> **Your work matters.**
>
> Every accepted task directly advances the development of AI coding agents by revealing their current limitations and pushing them to improve.

## Your Role as a Coding Expert

1. **Design tasks** grounded in a real domain, that challenge frontier models
2. **Write oracle solutions** that demonstrate correct completion
3. **Build verifiers** that check semantics, not appearance
4. **Iterate on feedback** from automated checks and peer review

## Difficulty Tiers

Difficulty is **measured, not declared** — from accuracy across GPT-5.6 and Claude Opus 5 (average pass@1 over 8 runs, 4 per model):

| Tier | Accuracy | Share of suite |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontier** | < 20% | 20–30% |
| **Advanced** | 20% – < 50% | 25–35% |
| **Core** | 50% – < 80% | 30–40% |
| **Base** | 80% – < 100% | 5–15% |

See [Difficulty Guidelines](/portal/docs/understanding-tasks/difficulty-guidelines).

## Evaluation Process

Each task goes through:

1. **Automated CI checks** — structure, manifest, dependencies, verifier isolation
2. **LLM-as-Judge (LLMaJ)** — quality evaluation
3. **Peer review** — human expert verification
4. **Agent evaluation** — run against Claude Opus 5 and GPT-5.6, 4 trials each after acceptance
